# DCR-TaxExport
This is a python script made using only default libraries for the sake of easy use and installation.

Idea of the script is to open CSV file in format used by Decred and clean it up so it's ready for taxing. Since the way of exporting of
ticket data is not that clean.

This script is made for and with help of a client Praxis.
