# Python-Crypto-Tax
This is a python script made using only default libraries for the sake of easy use and installation for people who are using crypto currencies and not familliar with python that much.

Idea of the script is to open CSV file in format usually used by crypto wallets and clean it up so it's ready for taxing. Since the way of exporting of
ticket data for POS is not that clean.

This script is made for a client Praxis.
